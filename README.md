# Bug Bounty Challenge

## Frontend Developer Level Test

**Developer:** Rubén González Aranda

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/rubenosaka/bug-bounty-challenge

---

## Challenge Overview

This is a React TypeScript application with several bugs and issues that need to be identified and fixed. The main task is to:

1. **Identify and fix existing bugs** in the codebase
2. **Implement missing features** as specified in the issues list
3. **Improve code quality** and resolve console warnings
4. **Add optional enhancements** like language switching functionality

### Known Issues to Fix

- Console error: Missing "key" props in list components
- Text formatting: Make "known" word bold in introduction text
- User avatar not displaying in app header
- Optional: Fix countdown timer issues
- Optional: Add language switcher (English/German)

### Tech Stack

- React 17 with TypeScript
- Material-UI (MUI) v5
- MobX for state management
- React Router v5
- i18next for internationalization
- Notistack for notifications
- React Scripts v5 (updated from v4 for security)

## Rubén González - Improvements

### Security Mitigations

I have updated the project dependencies and applied security overrides:

**Major Updates:**

- Updated `react-scripts` from v4.0.3 to v5.0.1 (eliminated 129 vulnerabilities)

**Security Overrides:**

- `nth-check@^2.0.1` (fixes ReDoS vulnerability)
- `postcss@^8.4.47` (fixes parsing error vulnerability)

This reduces vulnerabilities from 138 (7 critical, 31 high, 100 moderate) to 9 (0 critical, 6 high, 3 moderate) - a 93% improvement. The remaining webpack-dev-server warning is pinned by react-scripts 5 and only affects development builds. In a production project, I would resolve this by migrating to Vite/Next or updating the toolchain.
